# Website

This is a React website which is built with [Tux](https://tux.js.org/). Tux is similar to `create-react-app`, where as most of the configuration is in upgradable dependencies. Additionally, we get Server Side Rendering for free, and we can integrate more tools without "ejecting".

The project is set up to use [`react-router-web@4`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web), [`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com/docs), [`react-async-component`](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-async-component) and [`react-job`](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-jobs).
